# Nesh_Project
Scrape information from a publicly available website to present insights about an Oil and Gas company

## From where
The objective of the project is to create a simple web interface where someone can search using  the Ticker Symbol or Name of a company and receive insights about the company. We used NASDAQ.com to extract stock price and other financial numbers.

API from Yahoo is used to extract the stock trends. We focused only on few companies in this project(OXY, EOG, APC, APA, COP and PXD) but any company can be added depending on the requirements just by using the corresponding ticker.

## Description

 Some basic insights are as follows:-
 
 * Last known stock price
 * Financial numbers like 1 year target, today's high/low, 52 week high/low and other relevant ket stock data from www.nasdaq.com
 * News articles published about the company. Sentiment analysis of the articles 
 * Stock price trend
